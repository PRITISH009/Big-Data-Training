# Big-Data-Training

This is the Tutorial Series on Big Data and everything you need to know about it.

<p>So, to understand everything correctly, we need to start from the very basics and answer all the whys and whats before we deep dive into the World of Big Data</p>

<h1>What is a Cluster</h1>
<p>You can think of a Cluster to be a lot of computers connected to each other which work together to solve a problem with huge resource requirements. The funny thing is the problem itself can be a very simple one eg.- like the word count probelm over an extremely large amount of data say 10 TBs of data. (although It is not something that you would need), but the resource requirement and the timeframe it has to be solved within may be something which has made the problem complex to solve. So a Cluster can be considered as a very large computer which provides the platform over which you can process huge amounts of information efficiently to solve a problem</p>
